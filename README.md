# About
Bash script I wrote to help me accept 3 reviews for a project from the WTC-LMS.
I got tired of having to create folder structure, viewing the accepted review's details, downloading the review code every time and therefore
made a script that would do all of that for me.

## Instructions
```
./accept_reviews.sh [THE PROJECTS NAME]
```
###### Example case:
```
./accept_reviews.sh Mastermind
./accept_reviews.sh Hangman
./accept_reviews.sh FizzBuzz
```

# NOTE
The script is setup for my device. Just change where the script will create/store the review code @ line 8 / line 45, 46.
